            <section class="ptedu">
               <h6 class="edu">Physical Training</h6>
                <p>Understanding the why behind your workouts is just as important as the workouts themselves. Personal training isn’t just about pushing your limits. It's about learning how to move with purpose, train with intention, and make your time in the gym as effective as possible. From learning proper form to understanding how different training methods affect your body, knowledge is power. Whether your goal is to build strength, improve mobility, or just feel better in your everyday life, I'm here to guide you with scientific evidence-based training principles tailored to you. The more you know, the stronger you grow.</p>

               <h6 class="educon">Mind-Muscle Connection</h6>
                 <p>It's not just about lifting heavy, it’s about lifting with intention. Developing a strong mind-muscle connection helps you activate the right muscles during each exercise, leading to better performance and faster results. Slowing down your reps and focusing on control can dramatically increase the effectiveness of your workouts, especially when targeting specific muscle groups.</p>

               <h6 class="educon">Progressive Overload</h6>
                  <p>Muscles grow and adapt when they’re challenged. Progressive overload is the principle of gradually increasing the weight, reps, or intensity of your workouts over time. It doesn’t mean going harder every single day, it means making consistent, manageable progress. This is key to building strength, endurance, and avoiding plateaus.</p>

               <h6 class="educon">Personalization Over Perfection</h6>
                  <p>No two bodies are the same. Your training plan shouldn’t be either. Genetics, goals, lifestyle, and medical history all play a role in how your body responds to training. Educating yourself on what works for you helps you break free from comparison and commit to a program that actually fits your needs.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="nuedu">
               <h6 class="edu">Nutrition</h6>
                  <p>Fueling your body isn’t about following fad diets. It’s about understanding how nutrition works and how it affects your energy, recovery, and overall health. By learning the basics of macronutrients, portion control, and how to eat for your specific goals, you gain the knowledge to make confident, lasting changes. I break down the science into simple, actionable steps so you can build a healthier relationship with food without overwhelm. It's not about eating perfectly, it's about eating intentionally.</p>

               <h6 class="educon">Micronutrients Matter</h6>
                  <p>Most people focus on macronutrients, but vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) play a huge role in how your body functions. Magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin D—they all impact energy, sleep, muscle repair, and immune health. A well-rounded diet full of colorful, whole foods helps ensure you're not just eating enough, but eating well.</p>

               <h6 class="educon">Ditch the Diet Culture</h6>
                  <p>It's time to stop labeling foods as “good” or “bad.” Restrictive mindsets lead to guilt, bingeing, and burnout. Instead, focus on nourishment and balance. All foods can fit into a healthy diet when you approach eating with flexibility, mindfulness, and a focus on how food makes you feel—not just what it looks like on a label.</p>
                  
               <h6 class="educon">Understanding Caloric Needs</h6>
                  <p>Your body needs a certain amount of energy (calories) to function, even at rest. Learning about your maintenance calories, and how to adjust them for fat loss or muscle gain, gives you the freedom to stop blindly following meal plans and start making informed, goal-oriented choices.</p>
