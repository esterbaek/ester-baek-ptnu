         <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p class="txt">
               My name is Ester Baek and I am so happy you are here. I am a current student at University of Cincinnati studying Entrepreneurship. I am certified through <strong>National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)</strong> for:</p> 
               <ul class="certs">
                  <li>Corrective Exercise Specialist</li>
                  <li>Certified Nutrition Coach</li>
                  <li>Certified Personal Trainer</li>
                  <li>Metabolic Specialist</li>
               </ul> 
            <p class="txt">I have been resistence training for 4 years and have played lacrosse and volleyball all throughout middle and high school. I have always lived an active lifestyle, but wanted more for myself. I have been working toward bodybuilding and have an ultimate goal to be the happiest, healthiest version of myself.</p>

         <h3>Why I Do What I Do</h3>
            <p class="txt">My senior year of high school, I tore my ACL and both my lateral and medial meniscus playing lacrosse. I was unable to be present for myself in the gym, so I turned to helping others get hold of their physical wellness during my recovery. While I didn't realize it at the time, my injury led me to find a new passion in helping others. I decided to start my own personal training and nutrition coaching business because along with my own success, there is nothing better to me than seeing others achieve their goals.</p>

         <h3>What Does Working With Me Look Like?</h3>
            <p class="txt">I am a firm believer in something is better than nothing. Life happens. It gets in the way and causes adversity. The way I operate, it will never be all or nothing. My methods involve working <strong>with</strong> your schedule, not <em>against</em> it. There is no reason for a busy schedule to be an excuse for why you are living an unhealthy lifestyle. I provide all of my clients with personalized plans geared toward their preferences. Rather than working with my clients on a scheduled basis, I allow room to breathe and act as a back bone of motivation. My biggest goal is to teach, not control. Working with me, you will walk away with knowledge you can then share with others in your life. My goal is not to make as much money as possible. <strong>My only goal is to help you reach yours</strong>.</p>
