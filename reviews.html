               <p>"Ester has been able to boost my motivation in the gym and has provided me amazing guidance on my fitness journey. Working with her has been the best decision I have made for myself. I specifically decided to work with Ester because I have a busy schedule with work and college. She has been so understanding of that and has created the perfect fitness routine that fits in my schedule. Even when I had rough days where I didn't want to work out or eat healthy, Ester was there for me to push me to show up for myself. She has changed my life in the most sustainable ways possible."</p>

               <p>"I started off having no clue where to begin searching for help on my personal wellness. I came across Ester and before I even paid for her formal services, she was providing me information on how to better my physical well-being. Working with her has increased my confidence exponentially when working out and cooking meals. I was always worried about spending money on things like this, but it is safe to say that Ester will make sure you are getting exactly what you need for the value of your money."</p>

               <p>I have personal health conditions that have always been an excuse as to why I didn't live the healthiest lifestyle. I worked with Ester for 4 weeks and in that time, I was able to learn so much about myself and see that my health condition does not prevent me from living a healthy lifestyle. While my journey may not look like the average, Ester worked with me and made sure I was doing well along the way. We worked together to create the perfect plan for me to reach my fitness goals. With no doubt, she had my health and goals set to a priority the entire time."</p>
